### Analysis 
Based on the chart below, May was the peak of successful theater launches during the twelve months with an appearance of a normal distribution graph.  
The failed launches were a bit more consistent throughout the year, although a little higher in the summer months, with dips in May and September and a 
spike in October.  Canceled outcomes were the largest in January and then were primarily flat with dips in July and October.
