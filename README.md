# Stock-Analysis
### Stock Analysis using VBA

## Overview/Purpose
The subject of Module 2 was creating macros in Visual Basic.  Throughout this module, and in separate steps and macros, Visual Basis code was created to analyze two years of stock data, create an input box for the data year, create output data based on the year chosen, format the output data (including font, cell colors and number formatting), and create a message box with the processing time.  The purpose of the Module 2 Challege, was to take those separate macros and create one efficient macro that was more concise in design and took less time to process. 

## Analysis and Challenges
A template was provided in order to provide a roadmap to combine the separate macros into one macro from 4 separate macros.  

### Analysis 
Based on the chart below, May was the peak of successful theater launches during the twelve months with an appearance of a normal distribution graph.  
The failed launches were a bit more consistent throughout the year, although a little higher in the summer months, with dips in May and September and a 
spike in October.  Canceled outcomes were the largest in January and then were primarily flat with dips in July and October.
