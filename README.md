# Stock-Analysis
### Stock Analysis using VBA

## Overview/Purpose
The subject of Module 2 was creating macros in Visual Basic.  Throughout this module, and in separate steps and macros, Visual Basis code was created to analyze two years of stock data, create an input box for the data year, create output data based on the year chosen, format the output data (including font, cell colors and number formatting), and create a message box with the processing time.  The purpose of the Module 2 Challege, was to take those separate macros and create one efficient macro that was more concise in design and took less time to process.  This was to be accomplished using "For Loops, "Nested For Loops", "If/Then" statements, "Nested If/Then" statements and indexing.  

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis 
A template was provided in order to serve as a roadmap for the combination of 4 separate macros created in Module 2 into one efficient macro.  The first step in the challenge assignment was to create a ticker index and set it equal to 0.  This was done in order to loop through the ticker volumes and starting/ending prices more efficiently as the data was analyzed.  The second step was to create an array for the ticker volumes, starting/ending prices.  The array allowed the creation of a simpler coding, and fewer loops, when processing the volumes and starting/ending prices.  The remaining code to create and format the output was essentially the same; however, adding it to the same macro saved time and allowed for the calculate button to be used.  

The end result was that the refactoring of the original macros saved time.  Below are the comparisons of the before and after for both 2017 and 2018:
