# Stock-Analysis
### Stock Analysis using VBA

## Overview/Purpose
The subject of Module 2 was creating macros in Visual Basic.  Throughout this module, and in separate steps and macros, Visual Basis code was created to analyze two years of stock data, create an input box for the data year, create output data based on the year chosen, format the output data (including font, cell colors and number formatting), and create a message box with the processing time.  The purpose of the Module 2 Challege, was to take those separate macros and create one efficient macro that was more concise in design and took less time to process. 

## Analysis and Challenges
